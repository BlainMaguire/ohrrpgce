WHAT IS NEW?                                                   

March X 2000

  * Adjusted levelup calculation, and fixed starting-experience bug
    for heros added at levels higher than 1

  * Fixed a bug in the "resume hero walls" plotscripting command

  * Fixed a big bug in the "while" looping command for plotscripting
    now it is possible to use a while loop that iterates more than once
    without crashing and burning :)

  * You can give your game a long title and "about" information that will
    be displayed instead of the filename when browsing for RPG files

January 31 2000

  * GAME.EXE now keeps track of how long you have played a game.
    This is displayed on the save/load screens instead of HP

  * Days, hours, and minutes of gameplay are available to plotscripts
    via the plotscripting functions: days of play, hours of play,
    minutes of play

  * Heros and NPCs are no longer drawn 5 pixels up from the maptiles.
    You can now set a custom "Foot Offset" for each map

  * File browser now alphabetizes file listings
    (only by the first letter, for speed)

  * BMP files of the wrong size and bit depth now show up greyed-out
    in the import browser

  * The PlotScript interpreter is now more resistant to being crashed
    by bad scripts

  * Fixed cursor glytch while picking tiles in tilemap mode

  * Fixed the swapped menu items in the graphics menu

January 25 2000

  * Reorganised the main menu, and put al graphics-related stuff in an
    "Edit Graphics" submenu

  * You can now make tiles on a map damage your hero when you step on them.
    Press H in wallmap mode to place Harm-Tiles. (default damage is zero)

  * The If-tag-set-tag conditional for text boxes can now set two tags
    instead of just one. In making this change, I removed the
    "If tag then stop" conditional, as it was pretty much completely
    useless, and as far as I know nobody ever used it. If anyone out
    there did actually use it, I appologise for the inconvenience.

  * The airbrush tool in the MapTile editor can no longer wrap over the
    edge of the screen and mess up other tiles.

  * Yay! The mapeditor in wallmapping mode no longer flickers in a
    seisure-inducing way. Yay!

  * Eliminated OHRRPGCE.ALL and OHRRPGCE.PAL. These files are no longer
    needed to run custom.exe.

  * Fixed the bug that resulted in corrupt map data after deleting a map,
    and repaired Map 0 in the default new-game. 

  * Fixed a bug that would cause CUSTOM.EXE to lock while exporting an HSI
    file if you gave something a name that ended with a very long number.

  * Fixed some crashes in the Shop Stuff editor

December 21 1999

  * Re-fixed the running-scripts-from-text-boxes bug.
    Deja-vu! I couldve sworn I fixed that already :P

December 19 1999

  * The HamsterSpeak syntax for math and comparison has changed.
    If you have a script that uses the old style of commands
    it will not compile correctly. See hamsterspeak.html and
    plotdictionary.html for details

  * Added the following plotscripting commands:
    getherostat, setherostat, setNPCspeed, suspendboxadvance,
    resumeboxadvance, advancebox, setheroframe, setNPCframe

  * Fixed bugs in the following plotscripting commands:
    addhero, swapouthero, swapinhero, lockhero, unlockhero

  * Global script variables are now stored in savegames

  * Autodetection and repair of corrupted maps

  * When you create a new text box, it takes its default appearance
    from text box 0

  * You can now set a hero's default level to "Party Average"

  * TAB characters are now allowed in plotscripts

  * HSPEAK.EXE now runs in DOS (for real this time :)

November 17 1999

  * Fixed the bug that stripped scripts from the text boxes that where
    supposed to trigger them

  * Fixed the bug in the "wait for hero" plotscripting command

  * I had to restore from a backup copy of my code, and a few commands
    present in the buggy November 12 update have not been reimplemented,
    namely, findhero, swapspecifichero, setherostat, and getherostat

November 11 1999

  * Reduced the conventional memory requirements of GAME.EXE and CUSTOM.EXE
    Im not happy about the way I had to do this, but too many people where
    getting DOS memory errors.

November 10 1999

  * Fixed the bug in CUSTOM.EXE that sometimes caused animating maptiles to
    crash the program

  * Fixed the bug that prevented one-time-usable NPCs from disappearing
    after you use them

November 9 1999

  * Plotscripting!
    For more information, view plotscripttutor.html, plotdictionary.html
    and hamsterspeak.html. I have also included the source for the
    plotscripts in Wandering Hamster so you can look at them for examples

  * fixed the nasty, but simple bug that used to cause GAME.EXE to crash
    on maps numbered above 39

  * CUSTOM.EXE now runs some checks on an RPG file before it will save it
    to help prevent corruption

  * Joystick support that actually works! Press J to calibrate at any time.

  * You can now link together Text boxes without going into the conditionals
    screen

  * The conditionals screen for text boxes is now much easyer to look at.
    Disabled conditions are greyed out
    "Always" conditionals appear in blue
    normal conditionals appear in brown

  * Quiting, or dying in battle now takes you back to the title screen,
    not all the way to the game select screen.

  * You can make your map display a default tile beyond its borders
    instead of usinging the camera to crop the edges. This way you can have
    a map where your hero is always in the center of the screen, no matter
    how close you come to the edges.

  * You can make your map wrap at the edges, so if you walk off one side,
    you automatically go to the other side. Great for overworld maps!
    (NPCs no not wrap)

  * GAME.EXE now prints an error message instead of locking if it cant find
    OHRRPGCE.MAS or OHRRPGCE.FNT

  * Consumable items that trigger text boxes are actually consumed now

  * You can give names to your Maps.
    these names can optionally be displayed when you enter a map,
    and the name of the map that you saved on will be displayed
    on the save/load screens
    (your existing maps may start with gibberish names that you will
     have to replace. this does not affect new maps)

  * If you use hero swapping to remove all of the living heros from a
    party, leaving an active party of all-dead heros, one of them will
    automatically pop back to life with 1 HP

  * When CUSTOM.EXE finds and attempts to recover unlumped data, it will
    save it with a .BAK extention instead of overwriting the existing
    .RPG file

  * assorted minor/frivolous/gratuitous bugfixes that you wont notice

Aug 26 1999

  * Repaired a bug in RPG file unlumping

  * Eliminated the delay after text boxes (actually just vastly reduced it)

  * Improved built-in Sprite editor and built-in Maptile editor.
    Added circle tool and airbrush. thanks to IronHoof for both

  * Assorted Small bugfixes

July 8 1999

  * Fixes the bug in the July 5 version that causes GAME.EXE to crash when
    you try to save. I cant believe I let that one slip past me! Argh!

  * Fixes a problem some people had with the "Do I have this item?" tags

  * A new feature has been added to several parts of CUSTOM.EXE that lets
    you delete all records after the current record. For example, RPG files
    created with older versions of custom.exe have 999 text boxes, even if
    you have not put any text in any of them. By erasing extra data you can
    fix the problem that some people experience with undefined heros, enemies
    or items getting filled with copies of the last hero/enemy/item you made.
    It can also slightly reduce the size of your RPG file.
    To use this feature, find the last record (last hero, last text box,
    last whatever) and press CTRL+BACKSPACE. this feature works for:
     -text boxes
     -hero data
     -item data
     -enemy data
     -attack data
     -enemy formations
     -map tile sets
     -imported backgrounds
     -all sprite graphics
     -shops

  * Maximum enemy definitions increased from 500 to 32767
    Maximum attack definitions increased from 200 to 32767
    Maximum enemy formations increased from 1000 to 32767
    Maximum map tile sets increased from 15 to 32767
    Maximum shops sets increased from 255 to 32767
    Maximum of all types of sprites increased to 32767
    (note that making 32767 hero sprites would be silly, because the limit
     for heros is still 40, and will remain 40 in the forseeable future)
    
July 5 1999

  * If you buy/hire everything in a shop and there is nothing left,
    you get knocked out of the shop (instead of giving you an unlimited
    free supply of the first item)

  * You can make a item call a text box when used. A positive "when used
    outside of battle" is still an attack, but a negative value now
    represents a text box.

  * Browsing for files in CUSTOM.EXE no longer crashes under real DOS

  * GAME.EXE does not keep all of its .SAV files in its own directory
    anymore. .SAV file now belong in the same directory as the .RPG files
    that they go with

  * Snapshot (F12) works again

June 21 1999

  * Fixed the bug that deleted the mouse cursor for some people.
    people who already have this problem in their RPG files need
    to go into the font editor and press CTRL+ALT+F to reload the
    default font

June 18 1999

  * Fixed the _other_ bug in levelup calculation.
    You will now have the correct stats at level 99

  * Tag Naming-- You can give descriptions to your tags to help you
    remember what each tag means

  * Second "Check" and Second "Set" tags in the item data now apply to
    selling items instead of buying items

  * Save Changes/Discard Changes choice has been replaced with
    Continue Editing/Save Changes/Discard Changes for the benefit of
    people who get trigger-happy with the ESC key.

  * GAME.EXE no longer crashes if you highlight "CANCEL" while picking
    a spell to cast and press left or right 

  * The map editor no longer crashes when placing doors on a map numbered
    20 or higher

  * New animating maptiles! The last two tile in a set do NOT automatically
    animate. Instead, you need to create animation-patterns. See HOWTO.TXT
    for details

  * GAME.EXE can now browse for RPG files in any directory
    (browsing other drives is not yet supported)

  * Windows users can now associate .RPG files with GAME.EXE and run any
    game just by double clicking it

  * CUSTOM.EXE can browse for BAM files and BMP files from any directory.
    You no longer have to keep it all in the IMPORT subdirectory
    (browsing other drives is not yet supported)

  * The lockup bug in the shop editor has been fixed

  * You can give descriptive names to BAM files after you import them

  * A built-in font editor!

  * NPCs set to "Chase" or "Avoid" no longer flicker

  * Passwords are stored in a more secure way

  * You can now add up to 32767 text boxes instead of just 999

  * The dialogue editor allows you to jump to any text box by typing its
    number

  * Tag-debug mode in GAME.EXE. Press F4 to enable it, and + and -
    to scroll through the tags

  * You can assign tags to be automatically set when a hero is in your
    party, is the leader, is alive, or is in your currently active
    party

  * You can assign tags to be automatically set when you own at least one
    of a particular item, have that item in your inventory, have that
    item equiped, or have that item equiped on a hero you are currently
    using
