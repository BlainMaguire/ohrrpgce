This is a minimal OHRRPGCE package containing just the game player.
It is mainly intended for packaging OHRRPGCE games for a different OS.

Minimal distributions of the OHRRPGCE which include the editor and
documentation but exclude extras (Vikings of Midgard and free resources)
are also available for Windows (as a .zip).
