If you are doing your own mouse control with plotscripts, you may want to disable some of these

Note that "Mouse Support on Menus" is still experimental, and does not yet work on most menus.

Note that "Mouse Support in Battles" is not implemented at all yet, but if you turn it on, your game will be able to use it when the feature is added in a future version.
