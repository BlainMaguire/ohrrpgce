Here you can browse for a BMP file to import as a background (aka backdrop).

Your import files should be saved in BMP format with any bit depth (1-bit, 4-bit or 8-bit (1, 16, or 256 colors) or 24-bit (millions of colors)).

Backgrounds can be any size. When used as a titlescreen or battle background it will be centered on the screen. Textbox backdrops and the "show backdrop" script command place the background at the top-left corner of the screen.

You can type in the beginning of a folder or file name to move the cursor to it. You can also press a letter repeatedly to cycle through files and folders starting with that letter.

Press F5 to refresh the directory as well as poll the names of all removeable drives (on Windows only).
