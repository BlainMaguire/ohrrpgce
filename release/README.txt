These scripts are for building and uploading stable releases of the ohrrpgce

All of these scripts need to be run on the appropriate platform
(except for the android one, which should be run on 32bit linux)

All of these scripts make James-specific assumptions, especially
about where the files will be uploaded, but also about which other
programs are installed and in some cases where they are located.

These scripts are only intended to be run on release branches
checked out from subversion.
