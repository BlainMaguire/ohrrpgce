<A NAME="map"></A><H4>MAP DATA</H4>

	The howto.txt covers most of this part. Here are some tips about map editing:<p>

1.When editing wallmap, since heroes/NPC walk 5 pixels from the bottom of the map, remember that
 you'll always see the top of their head if they're on a overhead tile (except is the upper tile
 is overhead too). Also remember that while placing NPC's that they'll actually be 5 pixels up 
 the place where they seems to be.<p>
2.While linking doors, you can link more than one door to the same door, but you can also link a 
door to more than one door (obviously not at the same time)! Make like three doors on a map 
(don't use door 0), then follow my example: <p>

	Click on the first statement, select enter door 1, exit door 2, exit map 0 and require 
	tag 2=0FF.<p>

	Click on the second statement, select enter door 1, exit door 3	exit map 0 and 	require
 	tag 2=ON.<p>

	Make a NPC that says a dialog that has the conditionnal: If tag	1=OFF(always)then tag
 	2=ON.<p>

Now before you talk to the NPC when you enter the door 1 you'll go to door 2 because tag 2=OFF by
default. Then, when you talk to the NPC then go through the door, the first statement can't be 
used because tag 2 is now ON so the next useable statement will be applied and you'll goto door 3.<p>


Note:If you don't put a second statement, the door will not work the next time it'll be used. 
However, if you put Door 0 leads to door 1 on map 0 when tag 2=OFF, when tag 2 becomes ON you will 
go to door 0 on map 0 (because of default values). <p>

<A NAME="attack"></A><H4>ATTACKS</H4>

	<I>Chain to... Chain %: </I>This is used to make a succession of attacks. <P>

Example: You want to make 
a drain attack. Make an attack named Drain, which will damage the enemy, and a Drain2 attack 
which returns the HP to you. Goto the Drain attack, set Chain to...Drain2 and chain% to 100. 
Putting a smaller number will result that the attacks will not be always chained. You can also 
use chain attacks to do Summon magic (the 1st attack is the apparition of the summoned beast, 
the 2nd is the attack who damages the enemy). Note: Set the attacker motion of the 2nd attack to
Null to prevent the hero from stepping back and forth between the two attacks. Also, you can do
a kind of critical hit by chaining an attack like 5% of the time after the normal Fight attack. <p>

	<I>Attacker motions: </I><P>

			<B>Strike</B> uses the hero's attacks sprites.   
                          <B>Cast</B> uses the cast/use sprite.
			  <B>Dash In</B> makes the hero go near the enemy then strike.
			  <B>Standing Cast</B> is like cast but the character doesn't step forward
 			  before the attack.
			  <B>Jump</B> is obvious but don't forget to chain to another attack with <B>Land</B>
 			  or you'll stay in the sky.
			  <B>Teleport</B> makes the hero appear in front of the enemy then strike. 
			  <B>SpinStrike</B> make the hero goes speedily left/right then strike.<P>

 	
	<I>Attack motions: </I><P>


   			<B>Normal</B> makes the sprite appear on the enemy.							
			<B>Projectile</B> goes from the hero to the enemy.							
                 <B>Reverse Projectile</B> goes from the enemy to the hero.
			<B>Ring</B> flies around the enemy then hit it.
			<B>Scatter </B>flies randomly then hit.<p>
			<B>Driveby </B>crosses the screen.
			<B>Wave </B>crosses the screens in multiple rows.
			<B>Drop </B>falls on the enemy.
			<B>Meteor </B>falls from over the hero to the enemy.     			
			<B>Sequential Projectile</B> hits enemies one after the other in spread attacks.<P>

	<I>Bitsets: </I><P>

		<B>Always Cure</B> cures the stated damage.
		 <B>Divide Spread Damage</B> makes an attack with for example 100 of damage on one
 		 enemy, 50 on two enemies, 25 on four enemies...
		 <B>Bounceable</B> means the attack is reflected by wall.(But status aliments aren't
 		 implemented yet.)
		 <B>Unreverseable Picture</B> prevent the sprite from being mirrored when used by an
 		 enemy.
		 <B>Steal Item</B> is not implemented yet....<P>

		 <B>Damage</B> is used to make an elemental attack. (You can specify your elements
 		 in Edit Stat Names.)
		 <B>Bonus vs.</B> makes the attack more efficient on this type of enemy. (Which you
 		 can again specify in Edit Stats Names.)
		 <B>Set/Unset</B> has to do with status aliments which aren't implemented yet.
		 <B>Useable Outside of Battle</B> is used for spells like Cure who can be casted
 		 anytime.
		 <B>Damage MP </B>applies the stated damage to MP instead of HP. Selecting this and
 		 Always Cure will result in a MP restoring attack.<p>

<I>Notes: </I><P>

1.Life-type attack could be done by selecting Always Cure and set the target to Ally 
(Including dead). Life2 attack could be done by doing a Life attack and set the Damage to Damage 
Pure: HP. <P>


	2.The damage of attacks is always randomized, although that option will probably be 
selectable later. So for now a Potion which should restore 100 HP will restore between 75 and 
125 HP. <P>


	3.To do a timer battle (like if FF5 when you have 1 minute to kill Odin), first do an
spread attack that has like 1000 of damage to kill your party. This attack should have a delay
equal to your time limit (a delay of 10 is like 1 second, so with a delay of 600 you'll have one
minute to kill the enemy). Then, make an invisible, untargetable, die without boss enemy that has
this attack. Set the enemy you have to beat to boss, and give him normal attacks.<P>

<A NAME="enemy"></A><H4>ENEMY STATS</H4><P>



	<I>General Data:</I> <P>

All that's there is quite obvious, except the item thing. You can select an
 		Item and set the % to 20 so that the enemy will drop this item about once each 5
		times you fight it. Rare items are dropped REALLY rarely, even if you set the % 
		to 100. The death text is not used and probably will never be.<P>


	<I>Bitsets:</I><P>

		 <B>Weak To</B> makes an attack of this element more efficient against this enemy.
		 <B>Strong To</B> attacks of this element are less efficient on the enemy.
		 <B>Absorbs</B> attacks of this element cures the enemy.
		 <B>Enemy Types</B> you can select more than one type.
		 <B>Immune To / Always Aflicted By</B> has to do with status aliments, which aren't
 		 implemented yet.
		 <B>Harmed By Cure</B> makes the enemy an undead.
		 <B>MP Idiot</B> enemies will cast spells even with not enough MP.
		 <B>Die Without Boss</B> enemy will die if no Boss is remaining in the formation.<P>


	
<I>Notes: </I><P>

See more information about enemies in howto.txt. An spawned enemy usually appear at the place of
the dead enemy, but you can change by placing an enemy in the first unused enemy formation slot.
Then set this slot back to empty. There will be no enemy but the position will be memorized for 
spawned enemies.<P>

<A NAME="hero"></A><H4>HERO STATS</H4>

<I>Notes: </I><P>

If a hero joins your party at his base level then you remove him using the conditional <B>if 
tag ... then remove ...</B> from the party, when he returns he will be back to his base level. If you
want that your hero keeps his level when he leaves, use the conditionnal <B>if tag ... then swap ... 
</B>out of the party. When he'll return with swap in, he will be the same level that when he left.

The hero's default weapon will disappear when he will equip a new one instead of going in the 
item list. <P>


	<I>Bitsets:</I> Similar to those of the enemies.<p>

	<I>Spells:</I><p> 

Choose a spell type, then use the arrow keys to select the spells then use , (comma) and 
. (period) to select the level when the spell will be learned or  if the spell is learned by item. Finally, 
goto Edit Strings and write a name for the command in the hero's menu. Here's the different 
spells types:<P>



<B>MP Consuming Attack</B> - Normal spells, cost the amount of MP specified in Edit Attacks. Example: James' Bubble in Wandering Hamster or Magic in FF3.
<B>FF1 Style</B> - Uses MP per level. Example: Bob's MagicSmite in WH and Magic in FF1(duh!).
<B>Random Effects</B> - Usally cost no MP, chooses a spell at random in the available ones. (If there's 
only one spell, it will always do it.) Example: Dusty's Refresh in WH and Locke's Steal or Setzer's 
Slot in FF3.
<B>Item Consuming Attack</B> - Not implemented yet.<P>

<A HREF="#toc">Back To Table of Contents</A><p>

<HR TITLE =" ">

<A NAME="item"></A><H4>ITEMS</H4>

<B>Info</B> is displayed when you look at the item in a shop.
<B>Value</B> is the standard buy price of a item. Items are normally sold for the half of their value.
<B>Used In Battle</B> means used with the Item command in battle.
<B>Useable Outside of Battle</B> requires an attack that is set to useable outside of battle. 
(It's obvious, but don't forget it.)
<B>Equipable As</B> can be set to Weapon or to 1 of the 4 Armor types. (Armor types can be specified in 
Edit Stats Names.)<P>


When you set the item to be equipable, the 3 last commands are enabled:<P>



	<B>Stat Bonuses</B>, which are added to hero stats. Note: Currently there's a small bug so these
bonuses becomes higher at level up, so the weapons and armors gain levels when equipped.							 
	
	<B>Bitmask</B>, which replaces hero bitsets.
	<B>Who </B>can equip it among your heroes.<P>


<I>Notes:</I><P>


	Items set to <B>Cannot Be Sold / Dropped</B> have unlimited use. You cannot currently remove them 
	with a dialogue conditional, but you will be able to in a later update.

	You can use symbols in item names by using the Alt key with any typable character. You can now edit them in the <B>Edit Font</B> section. Here 
	is the list of default symbols:<P>

<A NAME="dlog"></A><H4>DIALOGUE</H4> <P>

The howto.txt covers most of this part but again, here's some useful tips about
 	  dialogue:<P>


1.The conditional <B>If Tag n:ON Then Stop</B> means that if tag n:ON the program ignores the other 
conditonnals of the textbox. It will probably be removed in future versions since no one seems 
to use it.<P>


2.In a dialogue, it is possible to make the hero choose between two things. To do that, first 
select edit choices, then set choice to enabled. Set the names of the choices and the tags they 
set. Example: The text 1 is "Ninja: Do you want me in your party". Goto to edit choices, and arrange 
the options like that:<P>


	<UL>
	<LI> Choice : Enabled
	<LI> Option 1 Text: Yes
	<LI> Set tag 3: On
	<LI> Option 2 Text : No
	<LI> Set tag 3 : Off
</UL><p>

Then, make  two other textboxes. Let's call them Text 2 and 3 and set their texts to "So I'll 
join you." and "Too bad. Tell me if you change your mind.". Set text 1 conditionals to:<P>


	If tag 1:Off(Always) then jump to text 3.<P>


Set text 2 conditionnals to:<p>

	If tag 1:Off(Always) then add Ninja to the party.<p>

Set text 3 conditionnals to:<p>

	If tag 3:On then jump to text 2 immediately.<p>

Now, when the ninja says text 1, you have to make a choice. After the choice, you always jump to 
text 3, but if you said yes, the text 3 will be skipped and the text 2 activated so that the 
Ninja will join you. Also, don't forget to Edit the Ninja NPC to "Appear on tag 3:Off". 
That will make the NPC disappear when he'll join you.<P>

3.How to make an intro: First, make some textboxes for your intro. Let's say that you use text 1,
2 and 3 (I am so original). Goto text appearance and select backdrops and/or musics for your texts. 
Also, if you have a backdrop, it's good to set <B>Show Box</B> to No. Well do what you want with the 
appearance, it's just a matter of taste. When your textboxes are ready, just link them using the 
statement "If tag 1:Off(Always) then jump to text (text number).". Now the major thing: create an
invisible, useable only once NPC who is activated when stepped on. Place it at your starting 
position, and set his text to the first textbox of your intro. Now you have a super intro. 
You can use this also for cutscenes (by placing the NPC on a door) or for an ending.<P>

<I>Note:</I><P>

 In the Wandering Hamster intro, there is a fade to black between each text. This can be 
done by adding two doors to the starting map. One which is unreachable (because of wallmap) and 
the other which is at the player's starting position. The first should link to the second, but 
the second should not link to another door. To make the blank screen effect between two texts, 
just add this conditional:<P>


If tag 1:Off(Always) then instantly use door (# of the unreachable door).<P>

<A NAME="music"></A><H4>FAQ ABOUT MUSIC</H4>

1.Why do the OHRRPGCE uses BAM Files instead of MIDIs?<p>

Well, I don't have the most technical explication, just ask James if you really want to know it.
However, here's some good reasons to use BAM files:<P>

a) They're small. Yes, I know MIDIs are small too, but BAMs are REALLY VERY small. A big MIDI will maybe slightly slow down the game, but it won't when converted in BAM. <p>

b) BAMs have fully customizable instruments, instead of MIDI's fixed palette of sounds... of course, there isn't any way to edit those instruments yet. <p>

2.What to do if I want my MIDI to not sound too bad in BAM?<p>

a) Try to record a limit of 9 notes a time.<p>

b) Don't put too much percussion because percussion isn't so well played.<p>

c) The real reason to not put so much percussion is that in BAM your melody will have almost the 
same volume that the others instruments. So if you put drums and heavy metal guitar in background
(which WILL happen when importing FF7 battle theme), they will be quite annoying and you won't 
hear your melody.<p>

d) Finally, don't use the synths effects (instruments #97 to 104 in General MIDI). I once used one
 and it didn't recognize it.<p>  

3. I don't hear anything in MIDI2BAM!<p>

<A NAME="draw"></A><H4>TIPS ABOUT DRAWING</H4>

1. <I>How to do an enemy that covers half of the screen</I> (like for example 240 by 160 pixels). <p>

Draw 80 by 80 pixels enemies that will be fragments of the main enemy. An alternative would be to
draw the entire enemy in any drawing program, then cut it in 80 by 80 fragments and import them.
Give the main part of the enemy (the one which will be targetable) the name and the stats for the
entire enemy, and set it to be a Boss. The other parts should be <B>Untargetable by Heros/Enemies</B>, 
set to <B>Die without Boss</B>, have some HP but no attacks. Do not do that, though, if you want an enemy 
like NeoExdeath or FF3's Final Fight, where each part is attacking and can be killed separately.
The only remaining step is to arrange the fragments togheter in an enemy formation.<p>

2. <I>What to do if the screenshots of your game (taken with F12) look bad</I>. <p>

Another way to take screenshots is to use the PrintScrn key on your keyboard, then paste it in 
your drawing program. Note: I don't guarantee that will work on all systems.<p>

<A NAME="swap"></A><H4>HEROSWAPPING</H4>

The last update of the OHRRPGCE gave a lot of new possibilities to the engine, thanks to 
heroswapping. Here's some examples of what you can do:<p> 

1. <I>Split scenarios</I><p>

To explain how to make split scenarios, I'll use as example FF3 (when you can choose between
Locke, Sabin and Terra scenario). First, you need a hero that will act as a "cursor" (i.e.: Mog).
When you arrive at the choose a scenario room, <B>swap out</B> all heroes except one, <B>add</B> the cursor
then swap out the last hero. Place NPCs of the heroes (i.e.: Locke, Sabin, Terra) in the room 
who ask if you want to choose their scenario. Choose a tag for each scenario (i.e.: 21, 22, 23)
and set this tag <B>ON</B> if the player answers <B>Yes</B>. Then if the tag is <B>ON</B>, use a door 
leading to the scenario and jump to texts that introduces it. Use them to swap in the heroes for 
that scenario and swap out the cursor.<p>

At the end of the scenario, use a door that brings you back to the choose a scenario screen, swap
out the heroes and in the cursor. The NPCs should appear if their scenario tag is <B>OFF</B>, so
you can't choose the same twice. Finally, you need to exit the room when the 3 scenarios are complete.
You have to make a exit NPC. Do three text boxes (i.e.: 51, 52, 53) that say <B>You haven't finished
all 3 scenarios</B> and a fourth box (i.e.: 54) saying <B>All scenarios completed</B>. The 4th text uses
a door that exits the room. Now arrange these conditionnals:<p>

Text 51: If tag 21 = ON then jump to text 52 immediately.<p>
Text 52: If tag 22 = ON then jump to text 53 immediately.<p>
Text 53: If tag 23 = ON then jump to text 54 immediately.<p>

2. <I>Vehicules</I><p>

Here's how I did my airship in SpellBind. This is not the only way, but it's the nearest to a 
real airship.<p>

 1.You have to make a hero and a walkabout for your airship.<p>

 2.Then I did a <B>2nd overworld map</B>, reduced by 1/2 in size, and with <B>no wallmap</B>. Note: You don't need
 this if you do a boat. All the others point are identical.<p>

 3.Then, I place doors near each location on the 1st and 2nd map. I also place doors somewhere you 
 can't reach in each map. So for 8 locations you need 16 doors on each map. The unreachable doors 
 on each map lead to the doors near the locations on the other map.<p>

 4.Then I do 8 dialogues (3...2...1...Land!), (3...2...1...Launch!), that <B>swap in</B> my 4 characters 
 and <B>remove</B> the airship when I land, then <B>swap out</B> the characters and <B>add</B> the airship when I launch.<p>

 5.I make two dialogues for each location, one asking if you want to land there and the other if you 
 want to launch from there. Say text 100-101 are for SpellBind. Here's what I do...<p>

<B>Text 100</B><p>

Edit text: Do you want to land to SpellBind City?
Edit choice:Enabled
Choice 1: Yes, set tag 100 = On
Choice 2: No, set tag 100= Off
Edit conditionnals: If tag 100 = On then use unreachable door on map 2 that leads near SpellBind 
on map 1 and jump to the texts (3...2...1...Land!)<p>

<B>Text 101</B><p>

Edit text: Do you want to launch your airship?
Edit choice:Enabled
Choice 1: Yes, set tag 100 = Off
Choice 2: No, set tag 100= On
Edit conditionnals: If tag 100 = Off then use unreachable door on map 1 that leads near SpellBind 
on map 2 and jump to the texts (3...2...1...Launch!)<p>

Do this for all your locations.<p>

 6.Place one airship NPC (step-on) near each location on map 1 that asks if you want to launch. 
 They should appear when the corresponding tags (see the dialogues) is ON. Then place on invisible
 NPC (step-on) over each town in map 2 that asks if you want to land. Just make sure to never place 
 an NPC over a door you placed before.<p>

That's all (finally), you'll notice than this takes tons on doors, NPCs, dialogues and you can 
have many problems to deal with.<p>

<A NAME="bug"></A><H4>KNOWN BUGS</H4>

Here's some of the known bugs of the editor:<p>

<I>Level-up bugs:</I> There are many famous level-up bugs. First, when an hero starts at level 10 
 for example, he needs all the exp. from 0 to 11 to reach level 11. Also, you cannot win more than one level in a battle.
 So if you win enough exp. for two levels in a battle, your exp. needed for level-up becomes negative!<p>

<I>Killed by the boss bug:</I> If you battle and jump to a text box in the same text, you'll do 
 the battle and the next text will appear after it. However, if you're killed during the battle, 
 the text will appear anyway and THEN the red screen appears and you return to the game menu. 
 Imagine being killed by the last boss of the game and seeing the ending!<p>

<I>Drop bug:</I> If you set many hits to an attack having the motion <B>Drop</B>, it will screw up
  in the battle.<p>

<I>Life bug:</I> If you make a Life (target ally including dead, useable outside of battle) attack,
 it will work on deads in battle both as an item and spell, it will work outside of battle as an
 item but not as a spell.<p> 

<I>Erase Map bug:</I> When you erase a map then edit the tilemap, the tiles are placed at many places
 on the map. (Try and you'll see what I mean.)<p>

<I>Die without boss bug:</I> If there's a <B>Boss</B> enemy in the formation and a <B>Die Without Boss</B> one,
 the others will die without boss even if they're not supposed to.<p>

<I>Stretch your drawing bug:</I> A rather funny bug. You should know that when drawing sprites you can 
 move the whole picture by pressing <B>Caps Lock</B> and an arrow key.<p> 

	Ex.: Caps Lock + Right = Moves whole drawing right by one pixel.<p>

 However, if you hold Caps Lock and press Left and Right <B>at the same time</B>, the leftmost pixels of your drawing 
 will be "stretched" to the left. In the same manner, if you hold Caps Lock and press Up and Down at the same time,    
 the upmost pixels of your drawing will be "stretched" to the up. Try it!<p> 

This ends this version of the helpfile. Hope it has been useful!<p>
