Be sure to Unzip CUSTOM.ZIP with directories (-d option for pkunzip). If you
fail to do this, your IMPORT directory will not be properly constructed. If
you have already unzipped without directories... oh, well. It doesnt make
that big a difference

Please see WHATSNEW.TXT for more information.

This is a TESTING distribution of the O.H.R.RPG.C.E.

Any .RPG files you create are yours to distribute as you please. You may 
freely distribute GAME.EXE, OHRRPGCE.MAS, and OHRRPGCE.FNT with your .RPG
files. Do _not_ distribute CUSTOM.EXE or NOTATE.EXE

HOWTO.TXT is a tutorial that will help you get started on making a game.
I reccomend that you print it, because it is a rather long file.
I apologise for not updating HOWTO.TXT very often. Some information
in it is obsolete.

the included files, SAMPLE.RPG , NPC_TAG.RPG , and PSTUTOR.RPG are part
of the tutorial
