Hamster Whisper is a plain-text editor with a built-in help
system and the ability to directly call HSPEAK.EXE to compile
your plotscript.

If you don't already have the OHRRPGCE (Official Hamster Republic
RPG Construction Engine) then Hamster Whisper will not be of much
use to you. Go to http://HamsterRepublic.com/ohrrpgce/ to learn
more about the OHRRPGCE and PlotScripting
