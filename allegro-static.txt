Linking Allegro Statically
--------------------------

The library path seems a bit odd, so you need to copy libdxguid.a 
over the version in FreeBasic\libs\win32 (rename it first, in case
you need it later). You can also copy liballeg_s.a into there, and
allegro.bi over the version in FreeBasic\inc.
