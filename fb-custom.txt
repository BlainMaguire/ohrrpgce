Initial translation
-------------------

Compat files won't be completely identical to game.exe. Need to 
either change the name or split out the unique parts.

all .bas files
- add compat.bi
- xbload duplicate (in compat.bi)
- bitset() keyword - changed to editbitset()
- ptr vars changed to pt

custom.bas
- name$() keyword
- option$() keyword - doesn't seem to be needed at all
- def seg stuff mostly changed to xbloads, which might not be appropriate
- npc%() and npc$() can't coexist - change the first to npcn()
- setmem, fre() stuff - replace with fre(0)
- data statments need quotes for all character data
- max used as array and int in shop sub, change int to maxcount

drawing.bas
- bit is a keyword, change bit$() to bitname$()
- uses a lot of DEF SEG & PEEK/POKE stuff which will all need to be
  rewritten, and I have no idea how to make it compatible.
  
flexmenu.bas
- bound function declared twice, in fact whole block of functions
- getbinsize needs to be declared (? apparently)

mapsubs.bas
- temp$ and temp$() are both used at the same time (as well as
  an integer called temp, by the look of it, but that doesn't
  seem to be causing problems yet). Changed temp$ to xtemp$.
- BSAVEs to xbsave.

subs.bas
- usemenu() duplicate definition
- name$ -> names$
- option$() keyword - change to opt$()
- in herodata max is used as an int and an array, change int to hmax
- same for itemdata - changed to imax

subs2.bas
- usemenu() as above
- name$ as above
- out$ keyword, changed to outf$
- textxbload has a def seg/bload. changed to xbload but might need
  further investigation (why is it different from normal xbload?)
  
subs3.bas
- usemenu
- name$
- remove xbload sub
- out$ again. Changed to outf$ again but doesn't make sense in this
  context (in subs2 it was a file name). Never mind.
